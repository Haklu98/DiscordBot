# README

## The sourcecode for this bot can be found from ([https://github.com/GandyT/Learner]) so shoutout to Gandy!

### What I actually have done with this?

- I have updated most of the code to use "let" instead of "var".
- I changed the usage of config.js to .env
- Updated most of the discord commands to use discord.js version 14 as the code was unusable in it's current state.
- I will put down comments on the code as to what everything does.
- Bear in mind: I'm still working on this one...

### Fun fact!

I actually found the original code from Gandy's youtube-video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cHG5YhYrZI&t=49s])
and thought to myself: "I need this damn code. It's not a 'want' anymore, I require it". 

And thankfully Gandy had been generous and provided the sourcecode for his work.

## Furthermore...

I will be working on this bot and I'll maybe eventually add a language detection system too, so it is able
to switch languages, should the user send somethin in other than english.
